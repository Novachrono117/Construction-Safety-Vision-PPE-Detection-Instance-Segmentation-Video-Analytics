# scripts/

Command-line entry points. Anything that produces a reported number runs from
here (or from a notebook that only calls into `src/`), never from an
undocumented one-off shell invocation.

| Script | Phase | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `check_environment.py` | 2 | Report interpreter, platform, repository root, configuration validity and holdout lock state. |
| `download_dataset.py` | 3 | Acquire the canonical COCO instance-segmentation export, hash it while streaming, extract it safely, and write its provenance record. Idempotent. |
| `inspect_dataset.py` | 3 | Structurally inspect the extracted export and write `reports/dataset_provenance.{md,json}`. Read-only; no EDA. |

## Rules

- Every script takes its settings from a file in `configs/` and writes a
  provenance record for what it produced.
- Scripts that touch the `test` split must go through
  `construction_safety_vision.splits.assert_split_allowed` and require the
  documented double opt-in.
- Prefer `uv run python scripts/<name>.py` so the pinned environment is used.

`download_dataset.py` requires `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` in the environment. The key is
read from the environment only, sent as an `Authorization` header rather than a
URL parameter, and never written to any file, log or provenance record.

Phase 4A scripts run in this order: `fetch_source_inventory` -> `download_source_images`
-> `audit_source_dataset` -> `eda_source_dataset` -> `build_review_package` ->
`write_audit_reports`. The first two need `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY`; the rest are offline.

## Planned scripts

Split freeze, training, evaluation, error analysis and video inference
scripts are added by their respective roadmap phases. None are stubbed in
advance.
